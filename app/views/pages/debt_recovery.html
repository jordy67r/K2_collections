  <p>Unlike some other debt collectors, our service is not restricted to just making a phone call.<br><br>We give you a comprehensive and proactive service that includes debtor tracing, doorstep collection and dispute resolution as needed.<br><br>All you need to do is call us. We will ask for details of the debt or debts you want us to collect and confirm our fees (we may be able to collect your business debts free or at a very low cost - click here for details).<br><br>Once you are happy for us to proceed we will get on with recovering your debts straightaway, and of course we will confirm everything in writing.<br><br>Most cases result in a quick and successful outcome but if specific difficulties arise we will discuss these with you. We will actively pursue all available avenues to collect your debts and we will keep you informed of our progress.<br><br>As a general rule, debts become tougher to collect the longer they are left, so please get in touch now if you have money owed to you. If you have any concerns at all about getting us involved in collecting the debt, just call and we will be pleased to chat to you first.</p>
