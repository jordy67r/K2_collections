  <h3>Outside the UK?</h3>
  <p>If you live or work outside the UK we can still help you, provided it is a UK debt - so the person or business who owes you money lives or works in England, Scotland, Wales or N Ireland. We have collected debts for overseas customers in Australia, America, China and several EU countries including Germany, Spain and France. Trying to collect a debt from outside the UK can be really tough, so why not use our UK debt collection service? Our fees are exactly the same as for our UK customers, and the 'no win no fee' gurantee still applies.</p>
